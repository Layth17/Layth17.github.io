**Goal**: _Amend_ the JTB (Justified True Belief) analysis so that we can preclude Gettier-type
(wrong evidence for a belief) cases.

- There are 3 proposals. We need to look for an “analysis that ties our justification more 
closely to the truth of the belief, such that it is less of an accident that the belief turns 
out true, given the evidence the agent has” (66) which is also known as 
<< _the accidentality problem_ >> 

**Proposals**:
1. **Causal Theories**
- This theory involves a subtly different understanding of the justification 
condition, shifting from “evidential” to “causal” sense of justification.
  - A belief is an instance of knowledge if the belief is true and is caused in 
_the right way_… i.e. The target belief is the causal result of reasons (other 
beliefs).
  - Example: You believe that there is coffee in the mug because when you 
look over there is a mug, and it contains coffee. Your belief is true because 
there is coffee in the mug.
- Goldman states, “S knows that p IFF the fact p is causally connected in an 
“appropriate” way with S’s believing p.” (68) … what is appropriate?
  - An appropriate process is a causal chain using perception, memory, and/or 
inference.
  - Problem: One can be led to infer that the cause of X’s death is an apparent 
death wound, but in reality, X was poisoned. 
- “Evidential” vs “Causal” Justification:
  - “Consider again the belief that there is coffee in the cup. Clearly, a causal 
connection exists between agent and cup, namely, perception. In the causal 
view, the fact of this connection is enough to justify the agent’s belief; 
there is a reason for the agent’s belief. In the evidential sense of reason, 
however, for the agent to be justified, the existence of this causal 
connection is not enough. The agent must also, at the very least believe 
that this connection exists” (69)
2. **Indefeasibility Theories**
- Indefeasible justification is one for which there is no _undermining evidence_.
  - i.e. there exists no other evidence such as that, if revealed, the justification 
would be undermined (very strong condition).
  - Undermining evidence is also called defeating evidence.
  - A justification is defeasible IFF there is defeating evidence.
  - Thus, “the sort of justification required for knowledge is not simply [JTB] 
but also indefeasible justification” (69) 
- Question: how to guarantee that there is no defeating evidence?
  - “Indefeasibility theorists do not require that an agent be able to show that 
there are no defeaters. Nor do they require that the agent believe there are 
no defeaters. Rather, for a justification to be indefeasible, these theorists 
require merely that there in fact be no defeaters. Whether this fact is 
reflected in the agent’s beliefs makes no difference to the defeasibility of 
the agent’s justification” (71) … *surprised Pikachu face* what is the 
point then ??
- Genuine vs _Misleading_ “Defeaters” Problem:
  - Example: You come to believe that planet earth is spherical. You saw the 
pictures, heard scientists talk about it, and read plenty of convincing 
evidence. One day, a video of the “Pope of Science” circles around where 
he states, “Earth is flat, and those NASA conspirators are brainwashing the 
public.” That might sound like a “defeater” at first glance, however, you 
were unaware that the video was actually a deepfake
  - Misleading defeaters are defeaters that can themselves be defeated to 
“restore” the original justification.
  - Indefeasible justifications must be able to withstand the acquisition of new 
information.
  - Robert Meyers: “What protects your knowledge is not the original 
justification but the fact that you learned the counterevidence along with 
the evidence that nullifies it” (73).
  - Response: “the indefeasibility theorist might suggest the following: a 
justification need not include evidence sufficient to rule out misleading 
defeaters; it is only necessary that the agent could acquire that evidence 
without changing or giving up the beliefs that comprised the original 
justification” (74).
- Practical Issues:
  - Difficult to find a way to amend the JTB analysis that distinguishes 
between genuine and misleading defeaters.
  - The condition may be too strong and rule out legitimate cases of inductive 
knowledge.
  - If the condition is weaker, it may fail to distinguish between defective and 
merely incomplete justifications.
3. **No-False-Premise Views (a 4th-condition approach)**
- Fourth condition: the justification does not depend on any false premises.
  - Too strong. What if some false premise is not essential to the justification?
  - “The agent would not be justified in believing that P unless the agent also 
believed some further proposition Q. The proposition Q is then said to be 
essential to the agent’s justification” (75).
- Meyers’ fourth condition: “S is justified in believing p on the basis of q only if: 
every proposition essential to S being justified in believing p on the basis of q is 
true” (76).
- Feldman’s Objection (Explicit vs Implicit false premise): if S had seen Nogot
driving a Ford and S had been told that Nogot owned a Ford, and had immediately inferred that someone in the office owned a Ford, then S’s justification would not depend on a false premise.
  - Response: whether S articulates or reasons explicitly from a false 
proposition, S clearly seems to believe something false (that Nogot owns a 
Ford)… but how to decide which “background beliefs” are essential to the 
explicit belief?

**Significance of Gettier:**
- Two main issues: (a) the nature of knowledge (b) the nature of justification
- As it stands, roughly, the 3 proposals present JTB as necessary, if not sufficient, for 
knowledge.
- It is possible to avoid the Gettier issue? There seems to be a gap between the 
satisfaction of the justification condition and the satisfaction of the truth condition.
- Ernest Sosa suggested that “knowledge is apt (true) belief” (77).
  - simple perceptual beliefs vs complicated chain of inductive reasoning
- Mark Kaplan hinted, in an article, that “It’s Not What You Know That Counts.”
  - The environment has deceived the agent, but what can the agent do?
- Gettier cases suggest that “we can have knowledge only in a generally cooperative 
environment. If we rely on our generally ‘accredited routes to knowledge,’ we count 
on the world being more or less normal” (79) … true, we are “lucky” the world is
sensible

**Accounts of knowledge and Justification (79):**
1. _Externalism_: roughly the idea that an agent’s justification or knowledge depends on some 
condition that need not be reflected in an agent’s beliefs
2. Internalism: roughly holds that a belief is justified only if the relevant justifying 
conditions are in some respect reflected in the agent’s beliefs or cognitive perspective.
- “The causal theory does not appear to insist that knowledge depends on the 
reasons for which an agent holds the belief. This has led some to think that 
knowledge is externalist in nature, while justification is internalist” (79).

**Foley’s Take (80):**
- “In asking whether a person knows, we are asking whether, relative to the 
‘neighborhood’ of the target belief, the person has sufficient true beliefs.”
  - Connection between knowledge and justified belief is “dubious.”
  - It is difficult to identify the relevant “neighborhood” (context) of a target 
belief, but Foley suggests that is true of any account of knowledge.
- “Foley further suggests that externalists are principally interested in knowledge, while 
internalists are principally concerned about the nature of justification.”
- This marks the “beginning of the division between internalist and externalist 
conceptions of knowledge and justification."
